Tired of setup hassles? [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) lets you spin up cloud-based dev environments in seconds, right from your forked repos!

## Here's how to get coding in the clouds

### Fork First

Find a repo you want to work on and fork it to your GitHub account. You'll need this as your Codespace starting point.

Don't you know how to fork a repo? [Here's a guide](how-to-fork-a-github-repository).

### Click to the Clouds

1. Head to the forked repo's page on GitHub and click the green "Code" button.
2. Choose "New Codespace."

Sit Back and Relax: GitHub takes care of the rest, setting up a virtual machine with all the tools and dependencies you need.
Welcome to Your Cloud Studio: In a few moments, you'll be greeted by a familiar VS Code interface, running entirely in your browser!

### Code, Commit, and Contribute

Make changes to the code as you would locally.
Use Git to commit and push your changes directly from the Codespace.
Submit pull requests to contribute back to the original project.

### Bonus Perks

- Collaborate Seamlessly: Share your Codespace with others for real-time joint coding sessions.
- Switch Between Devices: Access your Codespace from any device with a browser, keeping your workflow consistent.
- Customize to Your Heart's Content: Tailor the environment with specific dev container configurations for your project's needs.

### Unlock a World of Convenience

GitHub Codespaces streamlines your dev process, making it easier than ever to jump into code, experiment, and collaborate. So, what are you waiting for? Let's cloud it up!

## Warning

Codespaces can cost you money if you exceed the free tier. Be sure to check the pricing details before you start coding in the clouds.

## The Activepieces stuff

When you create a new Codespace for Activepieces, you need to wait for a few minutes for the environment to be ready. Once the environment is ready, you can start coding right away. It will install all the necessary dependencies and tools for you. Also, it will recommend you to install the recommended extensions for the project (install that).
